Its expansion is nearly uniform over the ordinary range of temperatures.\\niii. It can be easily seen through the glass because it is opaque and shining in colour.\\niv. It does not wet the glass.\\nv.

Explain.\\n$2 a$ Glass is bad conductor of heat. As hot water is poured in it, the inner part of glass expands more quickly than outer part. Therefore, there is unequal expansion between inner and outer layers, which causes crack.\\n2. 2073 Supp Q.No. 2a Two metallic rod of the same material but of different length are heated. Smaller rod has circular area of cross-section but larger rod has rectangular cross-section. Will their linear expansivity be the same or different?

Since the expansivity of metal is greater than the expansivity of glass, so cap expands before the heat reaches the bottle and hence, the metal cap will be loosened.\\n4. 2072 Set E Q.No. 2a Explain why the possibility of \"water taps burst\" rises in severe winter.\\n$2 a$ In cold weather, when water trapped in a pipe cools further from $4^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ to $0^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$, it.freezes. The water on cooling from $4^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ to $0^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$, expands considerably due to anomalous expansion of water. But the size of the pipes contract due to the fall in temperature. The expansion in volume of water in the ice gives outward pressure in the pipe due to which the pipe bursts.\\n5. 2071 Supp Q.No. 2a A square brass plate has a large circular hole cut in its centre. If the plate is heated, it will expand. Will the diameter of the hole expand or contract? Explain your answer.\\n$2 a$ When a metallic block with a hole on it is heated, its all the dimensions are expanded including hole. A useful analogy to thermal expansion is dimension of the object undergoes the same fractional change. Thus, increase in temperature will expand thehole, not\\'reduce it.\\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\\n\\nFig: Thermal expansion of a plate with a hole.\\n6. 2071 Set C Q.No. 2 b Explain the significance of anomalous expansion of water with an example observed in nature.\\n$2 a$ Most of the liquids expand on being heated but water behaves in a peculiar manner. Water in the range of $0^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ to $4^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ contracts with increasing temperature. Its coefficient of volume expansion is negative in this range. Above this temperature, water expands. Hence, water has maximum density at $0^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$. Such behaviour of water is called anomalous expansion. The anomalous expansion of water has important effect on plant and animal life in lakes when the surface temperature is below $4^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$. The water near the surface is less dense than water below it and so, it remains there colder than the water at the bottom. As the surface freezes, the ice floats on the surface while water at $4^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ remains at bottom where aquatic life remains alive. Hence, aquatic plants and animals can serve in very cold places due to property of anomalous expansion of water.\\n7. 2071 Set D Q.No. 2 a Define the coefficient of cubical expansion of a solid and hence, write an expression for the variation of its density with temperature.\\n$2 a$ Coefficient of cubical expansion of solid is defined as the change in volume per unit original volume per unit rise in temperature.', 'type': 'Document'}, {'id': None, 'metadata': {'source': 'pdf/physics.pdf', 'page': 5}, 'page_content': \"i.e. $\\\\gamma=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta V}{V_{0} \\\\Delta \\\\theta}$\\n\\nThe variation of density with temperature is\\n$\\\\rho_{2}=\\\\frac{\\\\rho_{1}}{1+\\\\gamma \\\\Delta \\\\theta} \\\\quad \\\\begin{aligned} & \\\\rho_{2}=\\\\text { density at } \\\\theta_{2} \\\\\\\\ & \\\\rho_{1}=\\\\text { density at } \\\\theta_{1} \\\\\\\\ & \\\\Delta \\\\theta=\\\\theta_{2}-\\\\theta_{1}\\\\end{aligned}$\\n8. 2070 Supp (Set A) Q.No. 2.14 Forzen water pipes often burst. Will a alcohol thermometer break if the temperature drops below the freezing point of alcohol?\\n$>\\\\mathrm{Forzen}$ water pipes often burst due to anomalous expansion i.e., expansion on cooling below $4^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$. At $0^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ the water has greater volume than at $4^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ but pipe contract on cooling, so, water pipe burst on cooling. However, the alcohol thermometer will not break if the temperature drops below freezing point of alcohol because the volume of alcohol decreases (or alcohol contract) on cooling to its freezing point.\\n9. 2070 Set C Q.No. 2 a A hole is drilled in a flat metal sheet.

No. 2a Frozen water pipes often burst, will a mercury thermometer break if the temperature of the thermometer is brought below the freezing point of mercury?\\n$>$ In cold weather, when water trapped in a pipe cools further from $4^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ to $0^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$, it freezes. The water on cooling from $4^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ to $0^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ expands considerably due to anomalous expansion of water. But the size of the pipes contract due to the fall in temperature. The expansion in volume of water in the ice gives outward pressure in the pipe due to which the pipe bursts.\\nBut the mercury thermometer will not break if the temperature of thermometer is brought below the freezing point of mercury. This is because, the thermometer as well as mercury contract on freezing.\\n12. 2067 Supp Q.No. 2 a Does the coefficient of linear expansion depend on length? Justify your answer.\\n$>$ No, the coefficient of linear expansion of a material doesn't depend on length. The linear expansitivity of a material is given as\\n$\\\\alpha=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta l}{l\\\\left(\\\\theta_{2}-\\\\theta_{1}\\\\right)}$\\nThe ratio $\\\\frac{\\\\Delta l}{l}$, is same in each case for a material.

No. 4 a Why are glass windows possible to be cracked in very cold region?\\n$>$ In the very cold regions, the temperature of the air outside the room will be very low as compared to the temperature inside the room. There is a large difference of temperature inside and outside the room because glass is a bad conductor of heat. Due to this reason, there is an unequal expansion of the outer and inner sides of glass and hence, the glass windows cracks.\\n15. 2064 Q.No. 4 a 2050 Q.No. 7 Two bodies made of the same material have the same external dimension and appearance, but one is solid and the other is hollow. When they are heated, is the overall volume expansion the same or different?\\n$>$ For the same volume, the expansion in two bodies of the same material depends only on the temperature. If two identical bodies, one solid and other hollow, are given the same amount of heat, the rise in temperature in the hollow body is greater than that of solid body because of large mass of\", 'type': 'Document'}, {'id': None, 'metadata': {'source': 'pdf/physics.pdf', 'page': 6}, 'page_content': \"the solid body. As a result, from the relation, $\\\\mathrm{V}_{2}=\\\\mathrm{V}_{1}(1+\\\\gamma \\\\Delta \\\\theta)$, the hollow body will have greater expansion though the same heat is given to the two bodies due to greater $\\\\Delta \\\\theta$.\\n16. 2063 Q.No. 4 a Why does a thick glass tumbler crack when boiling water is poured on it?\\n$2 x$ Please refer to 2076 GIE Set B Q.No. 2a\\n17. 2062 Q.No. 4 a Why a column of mercury in a thermometer first descends slightly and then rises when placed in hot water? Explain.\\n$2 x$ When a mercury thermometer is placed in hot water, the bulb at first gets heat from outside and expands and hence, the column of mercury in thermometer at first descends slightly. Later on, heat is passed to the mercury and it expands. We know that, the expansivity of Hg is greater than that of the material of the bulb and hence, the level of mercury in the thermometer first descends slightly and then rises when placed in hot water.\\n18. 2058 Q.No. 4 a Fishes stay alive in frozen pond in winter.

At $4^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$, water has lowest volume and highest density which remains inside the pond and the ice which has the temperature below. $4^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ lies on the surface of pond because it has lower density.

Why?\\n$2 x$ When a body is converted from liquid to vapour state, much more energy is required than the energy needed to convert same body or substance from solid to liquid state. It is due to the reason that to convert a material liquid to vapour, the molecules are to be separated out by large distance where as to convert from solid to liquid, the molecules are to be separated by relatively smaller distances. Hence, latent heat of vapourization of a materials is greater than that of latent heat of fusion.\\n2. 2075 Set A Q.No. 2d Why does steam at $100^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ give more severe burn than water at the same temperature? The amount of heat contained in steam at $100^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ is $540 \\\\mathrm{cal} / \\\\mathrm{gm}$ (latent heat of vaporization) more than that of water at $100^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$. So, when we touch the steam, more heat flows to our body than from water, both being at $100^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$. Hence, steam at $100^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ produce more severe burn than water at the same temperature.\\n3. 2073 Set C Q.No. 2a Groundnuts are fried along with sand, why?\\n$2 x$ The specific heat capacity of sand is low i.e. its temperature rapidly increases with small increase in heat. When the groundnut fried along with sand, the groundnut gets fried fastly with lower heat supplied due to greater temperature.\\n4. 2072 Supp Q.No. 2a Why is the groundnut fried along with sand?\\n$2 x$ Please refer to 2073 Set C Q.No. $2 a$\\n5. 2072 Set E Q.No. 2d Water remains cool in earthen pots than in metal pots in summer. Explain why?\\n$2 x$ The earthen'pot consists of a large number of small pores. Through these pores, water comes out and is evaporated. For the evaporation, heat is absorbed from the water inside the pot. Since, the water inside the pot has lost heat, it remains cold in the earthen pot during the summer.\\n6. 2069 Supp Q.No. 2a A medical officer prescribes to put wet cloths on the forehead of a person suffering from high fever, why?\\n$2 x$ Water has large specific heat capacity. When a wet cloth is-kept on the forehead of a person, it absorbs large amount of heat from the person's forehead without rising its temperature and temperature of the high fever person falls down quickly. Thus, the person feels relief on loosing heat. Therefore, during high fever, a wet cloth is kept on the forehead of a person.\\n7. 2069 Supp Q.No. 2c Why does the temperature of ice fall when some salt is added to it?\\n$2 x$ When salt is added to the ice, the ice provides latent heat to the salt to melt. Since, the ice loses heat its temperature falls.\\n8. 2069 (Set A) Q. No. 2b if you add heat to an object, do you necessarily increases its temperature? Justify your.\\n$2 x$ No, the temperature of the object is not necessarily increased if the object is heated. As an example, the ice gets melted when it is heated at zero degree without gaining its temperature i.e. at latent heat of fusion of ice and similarly at the latent heat of vaporization.\\n9. 2069 (Set A) Old Q.

No. 2a Why do you feel cool in the mouth when you eat halls?\\n$2 x$ Halls needs certain heat energy to melt when it is kept into the mouth, it takes some energy. This means our body losses some heat energy to melt the halls. Since mouth losses heat, we feel cold.\\n11. 2069 Old (Set B) Q. No. 4b Why does a food cook faster in pressure cooker than open vessel with boiling water?\\n$2 x$ When the amount of water vapor and hence, water vapor pressure above the surface of water level increases, the boiling point of the water also increases. Pressure cooker is a closed vessel. When water is heated in it, pressure of water vapor above the surface of water increases, so boiling point of water rises( since a liquid boils when its vapour pressure becomes equal to the pressure above its surface) above $100^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$. It means, the same mass of the water contains more amount of heat.

Suppose $m_{c}$ and $S_{c}$ are the mass and specific heat capacity of calorimeter respectively and $m_{w}$ is the mass of water taken in calorimeter and $S_{w}$ specific heat capacity of water. When the solid is dropped into water, the temperature of water increased and temperature of solid decreased. By stiring water, it can reach to a constant temperature. The final constant temperature $T$ is noted.\\n![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)\\n\\nNow, Heat lost by the body when its temperature fall from $T_{2}$ to $T=m_{s} S_{s}\\\\left(T_{2}-T\\\\right)$\\nHeat gained by calorimeter and water system\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n& =m_{c} S_{c}\\\\left(T-T_{1}\\\\right)+m_{w} S_{w}\\\\left(T-T_{1}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\n& =\\\\left(m_{c} S_{c}+m_{w} S_{w}\\\\right)\\\\left(T-T_{1}\\\\right)\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nNow, according to principle of calorimetry, heat lost by hot body $=$ heat gain by calorimeter and water system.\\n$m_{s} S_{s}\\\\left(T_{2}-T\\\\right)=\\\\left(m_{c} S_{c}+m_{w} S_{w}\\\\right)\\\\left(T-T_{1}\\\\right)$\\n$\\\\therefore S_{s}=\\\\frac{\\\\left(m_{s} S_{c}+m_{w} S_{w}\\\\right)\\\\left(T-T_{1}\\\\right)}{m_{s}\\\\left(T_{2}-T\\\\right)}$\\nThus, the specific heat capacity of solid can be calculated by using above expression.\\n28. 2074 Supp. Q.No. 65 State Newton's law of cooling.

Explain, why?\\n$\\\\rightarrow$ The black bodies are good absorber of heat and polished shining bodies are good heat reflectors. Cooking utensils are blackened at the bottom because it absorbs heat while cooking and upper surface is polished to reflect heat to food, i.e., to avoid loss of heat. So, cooking utensils are blackened at the bottom and polished on the upper surface.\\n2. 2075 GIE Q.No. 24 How can water be boiled in a thin paper cup?\\n$\\\\rightarrow$ The boiling of water requires $100^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ whereas the burning of paper requires its ignition temperature which is greater than $100^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$. When water is heated in a paper cup, heat goes to the paper as well as water, so the temperature of water as well as the cup rise to $100^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ first. Then water starts to boil. At that time, the ignition temperature of paper is still not arrived, so it does not burn. As the process of boiling goes on, a condition is reached when water finishes off. Then only all the heat is directed to paper, raising its temperature heavily and ultimately burning it.\\n3. 2075 GIE Q.No. 2c 2069 (Set A) Q. No. 2c Why are the polar regions much cooler than the equatorial regions despite the fact that the polar regions are periodically tilted towards the sun?\\n$\\\\rightarrow$ The heat received by the surface of earth is given by $\\\\mathrm{E}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{r}^{2}} \\\\operatorname{Cos} \\\\theta$, where, $\\\\theta$ is the angle between incident ray and normal drawn on the surface, $r$ be the distance between the sun and earth, I be the intensity of heat radiation. The heat rays of sun fall obliquely at the Polar Regions and straight at the equator. Due to this reason, the polar regions of the earth are much cooler than equatorial regions even they are tilted toward the sun periodically.\\n4. 2075 Set B Q.No. 24 What is the physical meaning of emissivity?

Physically it gives the closeness of the body to the perfectly black body.\\n5. 2072 Supp Q.No. 24 Air is a bad conductor of heat. Why do you feel-cool without cloth in your body? 2\\n$\\\\rightarrow$ Air is bad conductor of heat, when we wear cloth; it stops the transformation of air from outside to inside and vice versa. i.e., the air trapped inside the cloth does not conduct heat to outside. If we do not wear cloth, there is no layer of air trapped around our body. Then the heat conducts from body to surroundings and we feel cool. So, even air is bad conductor of heat, we feel cool without cloth in our body.\\n6. 2072 Supp Q.No. 2c 2069 (Set B) Q. No. 2c 2052 Q.No. 7a Although aluminium is good conductor of heat, how can aluminium foil with shining surface can be used to keep food hot for a long time?\\n$\\\\rightarrow$ The reflection of heat radiation depends up on the shining properties of the material. Aluminium foil is too much shiny, and reflects most of the heat radiations falling on it. The reflected heat from the aluminium surface again goes to the food materials. So loss of heat from the food is prevented and the food would remain warm for a long time. The shiny surface reflects heat radiations falling on it, thus, prevents the heat from food being lost and keeps the food warm from a long time.\\n7. 2070 Set C Q.No. 24 Birds often swell their feathers in winter.

This absorbed heat is lost by the pipe in the form of radiation. We know that, good absorbers are good radiators also. So, the black painted pipe used in a room radiates more heat than the pipe painted with other colors and hence, keeps the room warm.\\n14. 2052 Q.No. 7 b Metal knob of door is colder than wooden parts at the same temperature. Why?\\n$>$ Metal is good conductor of heat whereas wood is bad conductor of heat. When we touch the metal knob of door, it conducts heat from our body consequently there is loss of heat from our body and we feel cold. However, when wood is touched, wood does not accept heat from the body, because it is not a conductor.

The temperature of air inside cycle tyre gets increased, which results to increase in kinetic energy of air molecules in the tube. This increase in kinetic energy increases the pressure in the tube-but the volume of tyre remains same.

Explain.\\n2. Yes, a convex mirror can form a real image if the object is virtual. - That is, if a converging beam is incident on a convex mirror, a real image is formed in front of it. In such case, the object distance is less than the focal length of the mirror.\\n![img-28.jpeg](img-28.jpeg)\\n3. 2074 Set B Q.No. 3a Use graphical method to locate image of an erect object placed before a concave mirror between its pole and the focus.

They make virtual, erect and diminished image of wide range.\\n7. 2072 Supp Q.No. 3b Does focal length change when the curve mirror is dipped in liquid? Why?23 No, the focal length of a spherical mirror does not change when it is immersed in water because the focal length of mirror is independent to the medium in which it is kept. As $\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{f}}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{u}}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{v}}\\\\right)$, it is independent of refractive index of medium. So, the focal length of mirror does not change when it is kept in water.\\n8. 2071 Set C Q.No. 3 b Spherical mirror may behave as a plane mirror as a special case. Explain.23 For spherical mirror, the focal length and radius of curvature are related as, $f=\\\\frac{R}{2}$. For $f=\\\\infty, R=\\\\infty$, which is case of plane mirror. Hence, spherical mirror may behave as a plane mirror as special case when its radius of curvature becomes infinity.\\n9. 2070 Supp (Set B) Q.No. 3 a A spherical mirror is cut in half horizontally. Will an image be formed by the botom half of the mirror? How?23 When we cut a shperical mirror into half horizontally, the radius of curvature is not changed.

[2] This is due to refraction (bending) of light while passing from water to air. In such case, object lies in denser medium and is viewed from rarer medium. So when light passes from denser to rarer medium, it bends away from normal so that real position is shifted to apparent position. Apparent depth is always less than real depth and hence, a clear pool of water always appears to be shallower than it is actually.\\n2. 2070 Supp (Set A) Q.No. 3 a Why does the sun look slightly oval when it is near the horison?\\n$>$ This is due to refraction of light when passes one medium to another. The density of the air in the atmosphere is greater near the surface of earth than above it. Thus, the magnitude of refraction increases with decreasing altitude. Due to this, the rays from the lower edge of the sun are bent more than the rays from the upper edge when situated at honizon. Hence, vertical diameter of the sun is shortened more than the horizontal diameter. That is why, the sun appears flattened at the time of sunset and sunrise because of refraction of light.\\n3. 2069 (Set A) Old Q. No. 6b A stick partially dipped in water seems to be bent. Why?\\n$>$ This is due to refraction of light. When a stick is partially dipped in water, due to refraction of light, it seems to be bent. When light rays pass from denser medium to rarer medium, then rays bent away from the normal. When a stick is placed in water partially, the light rays from different portions of the dipped part of the stick undergo bending away from the normal to reach the eyes. So, it seems to be bending.\\n4. 2062 Q.No. 6 b Can total internal reflection be achieved if object originates in rarer medium? Explain with a diagram to justify your answer.\\n$>$ No, total internal reflection can not be achieved if object originates in rarer medium. For total internal reflection, the light ray must pass from denser to rarer media and angle of incidence in denser medium must be greater than critical angle so that angle of refraction in rarer medium is $90^{\\\\circ}$.\\nIf light passes from rarer to denser medim, the light ray bend towards normal and can't be achieved total internal reflection.\\n![img-34.jpeg](img-34.jpeg)\\n5. 2061 Q.No. 6 b A ray of light in air strikes a glass surface. Is there a range of angles for which total internal reflection takes place?\\n$>$ No, there is not a range of angles for which total internal reflection takes place when a ray of light in air strikes a glass surface. It is because for total internal reflection, light should travel from denser medium to rarer medium. But here, air is rarer medium and glass is denser medium. So, this phenomenon does not happen in this case.\\n6. 2058 Q.No. 6 c Why does diamond sparkle?\\n$>$ Diamond shines because of total internal reflection of light. The refractive index of diamond is 2.4 and hence, its critical angle is small, $24.6^{\\\\circ}$. The surfaces of the diamond are cut such that light in it undergoes multiple total internal reflections. The light coming out of some faces makes brilliancy of the diamond.\\n7. 2057 Q.No. 6 b Why does the sun look a little oval when it is at the horizon?\\n$>$ Please refer to 2070 Supp (Set A) Q.No. 3 a\\n8. 2054 Q.No. 11 b Why do in summer, roads often appear to be covered with water when seen from a distance? Explain.\\n$>$ This is due to total internal reflection of light. In summer, during day time, the layers of air in contact with the road become very hot and upper layer of air remains cold, so the densities and refractive indices of these layers are lower than those of the cooler layers higher up. The rays of light from a distance object bend more and more as they pass through denser (cold air) to rarer (hot air) medium. When the beam falls on a layer at an angle greater than the critical angle for it, it gets totally reflected. These reflected rays then travel up and undergo a series of refractions, but in a direction opposite to those in the first case.\", 'type': 'Document'}, {'id': None, 'metadata': {'source': 'pdf/physics.pdf', 'page': 72}, 'page_content': \"These rays finally reach observer's eyes, which see an inverted image of the object, as though reflected from a pool of water.\\n9. 2054 Q.No. 11 b Why does a clear pool of water always appear to be shallower than it actually is?\\n$3 x$ Please refer to 2076 Set C Q.No. 3a\\n\\n# Long Answer Questions \\n\\n10. 2076 GIE Set B Q.No. 7a What is lateral shift?

For this, draw a sphere of radius $r$, such that $r<R$ and concentric to the charged sphere as shown in figure. Thus, the surface of this sphere is the Gaussian surface. Since there is no charge inside the charged sphere, the Gaussian surface does not enclosed any charge. So, the charge inside the Gaussian surface, is $q=0$. If $E$ be the electric field intensity at point $P$, the flux passing through the surface is\\n$\\\\phi=E \\\\times A$\\nBut from Gauss's theorem, the flux passing through the sphere is\\n$\\\\phi=\\\\frac{q}{\\\\epsilon_{0}}$\\nwhere, $q$ is the charge inside the Gaussian\\nsurface, which is equal to zero.\\nThen, we have\\n$E \\\\times A=\\\\frac{q}{\\\\epsilon_{0}}$\\nor, $E \\\\times 4 \\\\pi r^{2}=\\\\frac{0}{\\\\epsilon_{0}}$\\n![img-77.jpeg](img-77.jpeg)\\nor, $E=0$\\nThus, the electric field intensity is zero everywhere inside the charged sphere.\\n28. 2068 Q.No. 8 a State and explain Gauss's theorem in electrostatics.

Since the expansivity of metal is greater than the expansivity of glass, so cap expands before the heat reaches the bottle and hence, the metal cap will be loosened.\\n4. 2072 Set E Q.No. 2a Explain why the possibility of \"water taps burst\" rises in severe winter.\\n$2 a$ In cold weather, when water trapped in a pipe cools further from $4^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ to $0^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$, it.freezes. The water on cooling from $4^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ to $0^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$, expands considerably due to anomalous expansion of water. But the size of the pipes contract due to the fall in temperature. The expansion in volume of water in the ice gives outward pressure in the pipe due to which the pipe bursts.\\n5. 2071 Supp Q.No. 2a A square brass plate has a large circular hole cut in its centre. If the plate is heated, it will expand. Will the diameter of the hole expand or contract? Explain your answer.\\n$2 a$ When a metallic block with a hole on it is heated, its all the dimensions are expanded including hole. A useful analogy to thermal expansion is dimension of the object undergoes the same fractional change. Thus, increase in temperature will expand thehole, not\\'reduce it.\\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\\n\\nFig: Thermal expansion of a plate with a hole.\\n6. 2071 Set C Q.No. 2 b Explain the significance of anomalous expansion of water with an example observed in nature.\\n$2 a$ Most of the liquids expand on being heated but water behaves in a peculiar manner. Water in the range of $0^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ to $4^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ contracts with increasing temperature. Its coefficient of volume expansion is negative in this range. Above this temperature, water expands. Hence, water has maximum density at $0^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$. Such behaviour of water is called anomalous expansion. The anomalous expansion of water has important effect on plant and animal life in lakes when the surface temperature is below $4^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$. The water near the surface is less dense than water below it and so, it remains there colder than the water at the bottom. As the surface freezes, the ice floats on the surface while water at $4^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ remains at bottom where aquatic life remains alive. Hence, aquatic plants and animals can serve in very cold places due to property of anomalous expansion of water.\\n7. 2071 Set D Q.No. 2 a Define the coefficient of cubical expansion of a solid and hence, write an expression for the variation of its density with temperature.\\n$2 a$ Coefficient of cubical expansion of solid is defined as the change in volume per unit original volume per unit rise in temperature.',\n",

At $0^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ the water has greater volume than at $4^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ but pipe contract on cooling, so, water pipe burst on cooling.

The water on cooling from $4^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ to $0^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ expands considerably due to anomalous expansion of water.

The expansion in volume of water in the ice gives outward pressure in the pipe due to which the pipe bursts.\\nBut the mercury thermometer will not break if the temperature of thermometer is brought below the freezing point of mercury.

Why?\\n$2 x$ When a body is converted from liquid to vapour state, much more energy is required than the energy needed to convert same body or substance from solid to liquid state. It is due to the reason that to convert a material liquid to vapour, the molecules are to be separated out by large distance where as to convert from solid to liquid, the molecules are to be separated by relatively smaller distances. Hence, latent heat of vapourization of a materials is greater than that of latent heat of fusion.\\n2. 2075 Set A Q.No. 2d Why does steam at $100^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ give more severe burn than water at the same temperature? The amount of heat contained in steam at $100^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ is $540 \\\\mathrm{cal} / \\\\mathrm{gm}$ (latent heat of vaporization) more than that of water at $100^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$. So, when we touch the steam, more heat flows to our body than from water, both being at $100^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$. Hence, steam at $100^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ produce more severe burn than water at the same temperature.\\n3. 2073 Set C Q.No. 2a Groundnuts are fried along with sand, why?\\n$2 x$ The specific heat capacity of sand is low i.e. its temperature rapidly increases with small increase in heat. When the groundnut fried along with sand, the groundnut gets fried fastly with lower heat supplied due to greater temperature.\\n4. 2072 Supp Q.No. 2a Why is the groundnut fried along with sand?\\n$2 x$ Please refer to 2073 Set C Q.No. $2 a$\\n5. 2072 Set E Q.No. 2d Water remains cool in earthen pots than in metal pots in summer. Explain why?\\n$2 x$ The earthen'pot consists of a large number of small pores. Through these pores, water comes out and is evaporated. For the evaporation, heat is absorbed from the water inside the pot. Since, the water inside the pot has lost heat, it remains cold in the earthen pot during the summer.\\n6. 2069 Supp Q.No. 2a A medical officer prescribes to put wet cloths on the forehead of a person suffering from high fever, why?\\n$2 x$ Water has large specific heat capacity. When a wet cloth is-kept on the forehead of a person, it absorbs large amount of heat from the person's forehead without rising its temperature and temperature of the high fever person falls down quickly. Thus, the person feels relief on loosing heat. Therefore, during high fever, a wet cloth is kept on the forehead of a person.\\n7. 2069 Supp Q.No. 2c Why does the temperature of ice fall when some salt is added to it?\\n$2 x$ When salt is added to the ice, the ice provides latent heat to the salt to melt. Since, the ice loses heat its temperature falls.\\n8. 2069 (Set A) Q. No. 2b if you add heat to an object, do you necessarily increases its temperature? Justify your.\\n$2 x$ No, the temperature of the object is not necessarily increased if the object is heated. As an example, the ice gets melted when it is heated at zero degree without gaining its temperature i.e. at latent heat of fusion of ice and similarly at the latent heat of vaporization.\\n9. 2069 (Set A) Old Q. No. 4a Water in earthen pot remains cold in summer. Explain, why?\\n$2 x$ Please refer to 2072 Set E Q.No. 2d\\n10. 2069 (Set B) Q. No. 2a Why do you feel cool in the mouth when you eat halls?\\n$2 x$ Halls needs certain heat energy to melt when it is kept into the mouth, it takes some energy. This means our body losses some heat energy to melt the halls. Since mouth losses heat, we feel cold.\\n11. 2069 Old (Set B) Q. No. 4b Why does a food cook faster in pressure cooker than open vessel with boiling water?\\n$2 x$ When the amount of water vapor and hence, water vapor pressure above the surface of water level increases, the boiling point of the water also increases. Pressure cooker is a closed vessel. When water is heated in it, pressure of water vapor above the surface of water increases, so boiling point of water rises( since a liquid boils when its vapour pressure becomes equal to the pressure above its surface) above $100^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$. It means, the same mass of the water contains more amount of heat. As a result, the food is cooked faster in a pressure cooker.\",\n",

No. 4c] Explain why a person feels cooling when he pours a little spirit on his hand.\\n$\\\\Rightarrow$ Perfume or spirit is a volatile substance; their molecules evaporate at a higher rate even at normal temperature. When they are sprayed over a skin surface, they take the body heat and evaporate faster. During evaporation, the body heat is also taken away by the molecules. So, that portion feels colder compared to other parts.\\n13. 2067 Q.No. 2 a During a high fever, a wet cloth is kept on the forehead of a person.

No. 4 a How is it that ice cream appears cooler to the mouth than ice at $0^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ ?\\n$\\\\Rightarrow$ The ice cream contains impurities than pure ice; as a result the melting point of ice cream is lower than the melting point of ice.

Why?\\n$\\\\Rightarrow$ If we wet our hands and pickup on ice tray which is below $0^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$, our hands may stick to it because the water of our hand freezes. The ice particles get diffused to each other and stick to each other. If we touch wood, the water and wood do not stick because their molecules do not diffuse with each other.\\n16. 2061 Q.No. 4 c] 2053 Q.No. 7 c] Explain why water remains cool in earthen pot in summer.\\n$\\\\Rightarrow$ Please refer to 2072 Set E Q.No. 2c]\\n17. 2060 Q.No. 4 c] Why do we feel cold when we spray perfume on our body?\\n$\\\\Rightarrow$ Please refer to 2069 Old (Set B) Q.

Explain, why?\\n$\\\\rightarrow$ The black bodies are good absorber of heat and polished shining bodies are good heat reflectors. Cooking utensils are blackened at the bottom because it absorbs heat while cooking and upper surface is polished to reflect heat to food, i.e., to avoid loss of heat. So, cooking utensils are blackened at the bottom and polished on the upper surface.\\n2. 2075 GIE Q.No. 24 How can water be boiled in a thin paper cup?\\n$\\\\rightarrow$ The boiling of water requires $100^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ whereas the burning of paper requires its ignition temperature which is greater than $100^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$. When water is heated in a paper cup, heat goes to the paper as well as water, so the temperature of water as well as the cup rise to $100^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ first. Then water starts to boil. At that time, the ignition temperature of paper is still not arrived, so it does not burn. As the process of boiling goes on, a condition is reached when water finishes off. Then only all the heat is directed to paper, raising its temperature heavily and ultimately burning it.\\n3. 2075 GIE Q.No. 2c 2069 (Set A) Q. No. 2c Why are the polar regions much cooler than the equatorial regions despite the fact that the polar regions are periodically tilted towards the sun?\\n$\\\\rightarrow$ The heat received by the surface of earth is given by $\\\\mathrm{E}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{r}^{2}} \\\\operatorname{Cos} \\\\theta$, where, $\\\\theta$ is the angle between incident ray and normal drawn on the surface, $r$ be the distance between the sun and earth, I be the intensity of heat radiation. The heat rays of sun fall obliquely at the Polar Regions and straight at the equator. Due to this reason, the polar regions of the earth are much cooler than equatorial regions even they are tilted toward the sun periodically.\\n4. 2075 Set B Q.No. 24 What is the physical meaning of emissivity? Write its unit.\\n$\\\\rightarrow$ Emissivity of a body is the ratio of the emissive power of the body to the emissive power of the perfectly black body at the same temperature, i.e.\\nEmissivity $=\\\\frac{\\\\text { Emissive power of a body }}{\\\\text { Emissive power of perfectly black body }}$\\nIt is the ratio of same quantity. So, it has no unit. Its value ranges 0 to 1 . Emissivity $=0$ indicate the perfectly shining and 1 means the body is perfectly black body. Physically it gives the closeness of the body to the perfectly black body.\\n5. 2072 Supp Q.No. 24 Air is a bad conductor of heat. Why do you feel-cool without cloth in your body? 2\\n$\\\\rightarrow$ Air is bad conductor of heat, when we wear cloth; it stops the transformation of air from outside to inside and vice versa. i.e., the air trapped inside the cloth does not conduct heat to outside. If we do not wear cloth, there is no layer of air trapped around our body. Then the heat conducts from body to surroundings and we feel cool. So, even air is bad conductor of heat, we feel cool without cloth in our body.\\n6. 2072 Supp Q.No. 2c 2069 (Set B) Q. No. 2c 2052 Q.No. 7a Although aluminium is good conductor of heat, how can aluminium foil with shining surface can be used to keep food hot for a long time?\\n$\\\\rightarrow$ The reflection of heat radiation depends up on the shining properties of the material. Aluminium foil is too much shiny, and reflects most of the heat radiations falling on it. The reflected heat from the aluminium surface again goes to the food materials. So loss of heat from the food is prevented and the food would remain warm for a long time. The shiny surface reflects heat radiations falling on it, thus, prevents the heat from food being lost and keeps the food warm from a long time.\\n7. 2070 Set C Q.No. 24 Birds often swell their feathers in winter. Why?\\n$\\\\rightarrow$ Since the rate of flow of heat from a body is given by\\n$\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{Q}}{\\\\mathrm{t}}=\\\\mathrm{kA} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\theta}{\\\\mathrm{dt}} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{Q}}{\\\\mathrm{t}} \\\\propto \\\\mathrm{k}$, for constant $\\\\mathrm{A}, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\theta$ and dx .\\nA layer of air is trapped between the feathers, which is bad conductor of heat and low value of thermal conductivity (K). It prevents the flow of heat from bird's body to the surrounding. Hence, birds often swell their feathers in winter.\",\n",

If the surface area is reduced, the heat radiated heat radiation from their bodies by reducing surface area, the animals curl into ball in winter.\\n9. 2066 Q.

Explain why?\\n$>$ Please refer to 2070 Set D Q.No. 2 b\\n11. 2055 Q.No. 7 c Why are good absorbers always good emitters?\\n$>$ Temperature is the effect of heat that means when a body absorbs heat its temperature rises. From Stefan's law of radiation, amount of heat emitted per unit time per unit surface area is directly proportional to the fourth power of absolute temperature,\\ni.e. $\\\\mathrm{E} \\\\alpha \\\\mathrm{T}^{4}$.\\n\\nIt means hotter body can emit greater amount of heat than relatively cold body. Hence, good absorbers are always good emitters.\\n12. 2054 Q.No. 7 d What is a black body? How is it realized in practice?\\n$>$ A perfectly black body is one which absorbs completely the radiations of all wavelengths falling on it. A perfectly blackbody can't be realized in practice. The nearest approach to a perfectly blackbody is a surface coated with lamp black, platinum black, such a surface absorbs $96 \\\\%$ to $98 \\\\%$ of the incident radiation.\\n![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)\\n\\nIf a small hole is made in the lid of a closed empty tin, the hole looks almost black although the shining tin is a good reflector because the light which enters through it is reflected many times round the walls of the tin, before it passes through the hole again as shown in the figure. At each reflection, absorption occurs.\\n13. 2053 Q.No. 7 a Hot water pipes used in the room are painted black. Why?\\n$>$ When hot water flows through a pipe, the pipe also absorbs some heat. This absorbed heat is lost by the pipe in the form of radiation. We know that, good absorbers are good radiators also. So, the black painted pipe used in a room radiates more heat than the pipe painted with other colors and hence, keeps the room warm.\\n14. 2052 Q.No. 7 b Metal knob of door is colder than wooden parts at the same temperature. Why?\\n$>$ Metal is good conductor of heat whereas wood is bad conductor of heat. When we touch the metal knob of door, it conducts heat from our body consequently there is loss of heat from our body and we feel cold. However, when wood is touched, wood does not accept heat from the body, because it is not a conductor. So, the body heat, remains preserved and we don not feel cool.\\n15. 2051 Q.No. 7 a How can water be boiled in a paper cup?\\n$>$ Please refer to 2075 GIE Q.No. 2 b\\n\\n# Long Answer Questions \\n\\n16. 2076 GIE Set A Q.No. 6b Define thermal conductivity of substance.

One end of bar is enclosed within steam chamber and a copper wire wound near the other end steam is passed through steam chamber and water flows through copper tube at constant rate. $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ are thermometers to measure the temperature of bar at a small distance $x$ apart. Thermometer $T_{3}$ and $T_{4}$ measure the temperature of outgoing and incoming water. To ensure good thermal contact, small amount of mercury is placed into cavity.\\n![img-13.jpeg](img-13.jpeg)\\n\\nAs the end $X$ of bar is heated by passing steam through steam chamber, so that heat is conducted from $X$ to end $Y$ and circulating water is warmed up. At steady state, the reading of all thermometers becomes constant. Heat lost from the surface of bar is neglected because the bar is lagged by some non-conducting material.\\nLet, $\\\\theta_{1}, \\\\theta_{2}, \\\\theta_{3}$ and $\\\\theta_{4}$ are the temperatures recorded by thermometers $T_{1}, T_{2}, T_{3}$ and $T_{4}$ respectively in steady state.\\nArea of cross section $=\\\\mathrm{A}$\\nDistance between cavities $=x$\\nTime for which the heat is considered $=\\\\mathrm{t}$\\nMass of water that flows through the copper tube in time $t=m$\\nThe amount of heat flows through metal bar in time $t$ is,\\n$Q=\\\\frac{k A\\\\left(\\\\theta_{1}-\\\\theta_{2}\\\\right) t}{x}$\\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity of metal bar and $\\\\theta_{1}-\\\\theta_{2}$ is temperature difference between two cavities.\\nThe temperature of water flowing through the copper tube rises from $\\\\theta_{4}$ to $\\\\theta_{3}$. So the amount of heat absorbed by water in time $t$ is\\n$Q=m S\\\\left(\\\\theta_{3}-\\\\theta_{4}\\\\right)$\\nFrom the principle of calorimetry,\\nHeat lost $=$ heat gain\\n$\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{kA}\\\\left(\\\\theta_{1}-\\\\theta_{2}\\\\right) \\\\mathrm{t}}{\\\\mathrm{x}}=\\\\mathrm{mS}\\\\left(\\\\theta_{3}-\\\\theta_{4}\\\\right)$\\n$\\\\mathrm{k}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{mS}\\\\left(\\\\theta_{3}-\\\\theta_{4}\\\\right) \\\\mathrm{x}}{\\\\mathrm{A}\\\\left(\\\\theta_{1}-\\\\theta_{2}\\\\right) \\\\mathrm{t}}$\\nWhich is the required expression of thermal conductivity of a metal bar.

Explain.\\nThe ideal gas equation is given as\\n$\\\\mathrm{PV}=\\\\mathrm{nRT}$\\nwhen, $\\\\mathrm{T}=0^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$, then $\\\\mathrm{PV}=0$ which doesn\\'t give any meaning (or becomes meaning less). So, the temperature scale in $0^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}$ is converted to Kelvin scale i.e. $0^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}=0+273 \\\\mathrm{~K}=273 \\\\mathrm{~K}$ which gives the physical meaning i.e. $\\\\mathrm{PV} \\\\propto \\\\mathrm{T}$. So, in ideal gas equation, temperature in Celsius scale is converted into Kelvin by adding 273 to it.\\n2. 2074 Set A Q.No. 2c When a car is driven some distance, the air pressure in the tyre increases. Why?\\n$1_{2}$ When a car is driven some distance, the tyre gets heated due to friction. When tyres get heated, the temperate of gas inside the tyre increased. Since the pressure of gas is the function of temperature. i.e. $P=\\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\rho c^{-2} \\\\quad\\\\left[\\\\frac{-\\\\overline{c} \\\\propto \\\\sqrt{T}}{}\\\\right]$\\n\\nDue to this reason the pressure inside the tyre increases on increasing temperature when the car is drive some distances.\\n3. 2073 Supp Q.No. 2c What physical concept is provided by universal gas constant? Write its unit.\\n$1 x$ The Ideal gas equation is given by $\\\\mathrm{PV}=\\\\mathrm{nRT}, \\\\mathrm{P}$ is pressure, V is the volume, T is the temperature and constant $R$ in equation of state is called universal gas constant. It is defined as the amount of work done per mole per unit temperature.\\nThe unit of $R$ is $J \\\\mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \\\\mathrm{~K}^{-1}$ and value of $\\\\mathrm{R}=8.318 \\\\mathrm{~J} / \\\\mathrm{mol} \\\\mathrm{K}$.\\n4. 2072 Set C Q.No. 2c Explain on the basis of kinetic theory that the pressure of a gas increases with increase of temperature.\\n$2 x$ According to kinetic theory of gas, the pressure exerted by gas moving with average r m.s. speed $\\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{c}}$ is given by\\n\\n$$\\nP=\\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\rho \\\\bar{c}^{2}, \\\\rho=\\\\text { density of gas }\\n$$\\n\\nor, $\\\\quad \\\\mathrm{P}=\\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{M}}{\\\\mathrm{V}} \\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{c}}^{2} \\\\quad$ At constant volume, $\\\\mathrm{P} \\\\propto \\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{c}}^{2}$. But $\\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{c}}^{2} \\\\propto \\\\mathrm{~T}$\\n$\\\\therefore \\\\quad \\\\mathrm{P} \\\\propto \\\\mathrm{T}$\\nHence, the pressure of gas increases on increasing temperature of gas.\\n5. 2072 Set D Q.No. 2c On reducing the volume of a gas at constant temperature, the pressure of a gas increase. Why?\\n$2 x$ On reducing the volume of gas at constant temperature, the number of molecules per unit volume increase. Therefore, more number of molecules collide with the walls per second and hence, large momentum is transferred to the walls per second. The K.E. also increases, as a result pressure increases.\\n6. 2072 Set E Q.No. 2b What does \"the kinetic interpretation of temperature\" signify? Explain.\\n$3 x$ According to Kinetic theory of gas, the Kinetic energy if gas molecule is given by\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{2} m \\\\bar{v}^{2}=\\\\frac{3}{2} K T\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\bar{v}$ is the root mean square velocity, T is temperature of gas and K is Boltzman constant. This shows that K.E. of gas depends upon the temperature.\\n7. 2071 Set C Q.No. 2 a What is the difference between a real and an ideal gas? Explain on the basis of the hypothesis of the kinetic theory.\\n$3 x$ Ideal gas is only hypothetical condition but the real gas is found in real life. These two gases have following differences on the basis of kinetic theory of gas:\\ni. The size of ideal gas molecules is negligible but the size of real gas has significant size.\\nii. There is no force of attraction or repulsion between molecules of ideal gas but there is force of attraction or repulsion between real gas molecules.\\niii.

No. 4 M Do you expect the gas in cooking gas cylinder to obey the ideal gas equation? 2\\n$>$ No, the gas in cooking gas cylinder does not obey the ideal gas equation. To obey the ideal gas equation, the temperature of gas should be high and pressure should be low. But the gas in a cooking gas cylinder has high pressure and low temperature. So, it does not obey the ideal gas equation.\\n10. 2068 Old Q.No. 4 M What are the characteristics of a gas to be an ideal?\\n$>$ According to kinetic theory of gas, a gas should have the characteristics to be an ideal,\\na.

The temperature of air inside cycle tyre gets increased, which results to increase in kinetic energy of air molecules in the tube. This increase in kinetic energy increases the pressure in the tube-but the volume of tyre remains same. While riding the cycle in summer days, the pressure of gas increases tremendously due to the rise in temperature and so the tube burst suddenly.\\n17. 2057 Q.No. 4 M At absolute zero temperature, why the kinetic energy is zero?\\n$\\\\Rightarrow$ At absolute zero, the gas does not produce pressure on the wall. from ideal gas equation, PV $=\\\\mathrm{nRT}$\\nFor, $T=0, P=0$\\nIt means that molecules remains at rest, i.e. speed of molecules becomes zero.

The collisions between molecules of a gas are perfectly elastic. That is, there is no loss of kinetic energy during collisions.\\nii. There is no molecular attraction or repulsion.

Yes, a convex mirror can form a real image if the object is virtual. - That is, if a converging beam is incident on a convex mirror, a real image is formed in front of it. In such case, the object distance is less than the focal length of the mirror.\\n![img-28.jpeg](img-28.jpeg)\\n3. 2074 Set B Q.No. 3a Use graphical method to locate image of an erect object placed before a concave mirror between its pole and the focus. Hence write down the nature of image so formed.\\n![img-29.jpeg](img-29.jpeg)\\n4. When an object $A B$ lies between principal focus and pole of the mirror, it's image $A^{\\\\prime} B^{\\\\prime}$ will be formed behind the mirror which is virtual, erect and magnified.\\n![img-30.jpeg](img-30.jpeg)\\n5. 2073 Set C Q.No. 3a A concave mirror is often used as an aid for applying cosmetics to the face, why?2\\n$\\\\Rightarrow$ For shaving or make-up purpose, I suggest concave mirror. When a concave mirror is used for this purpose, our face or object lies between focus and optical centre, so that highly enlarged, virtual, erect image is formed behind the mirror show in diagram.\\n![img-31.jpeg](img-31.jpeg)\\n6. 2073 Set D Q.No. 3a Convex mirrors are used as rear view mirrors in cars, why?23 Convex mirrors are used as rear view mirrors in automobiles to see the traffic at the backside. They provide wider angle of view, although the images are diminished. They make virtual, erect and diminished image of wide range.\\n7. 2072 Supp Q.No. 3b Does focal length change when the curve mirror is dipped in liquid? Why?23 No, the focal length of a spherical mirror does not change when it is immersed in water because the focal length of mirror is independent to the medium in which it is kept. As $\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{f}}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{u}}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{v}}\\\\right)$, it is independent of refractive index of medium. So, the focal length of mirror does not change when it is kept in water.\\n8. 2071 Set C Q.No. 3 b Spherical mirror may behave as a plane mirror as a special case. Explain.23 For spherical mirror, the focal length and radius of curvature are related as, $f=\\\\frac{R}{2}$. For $f=\\\\infty, R=\\\\infty$, which is case of plane mirror. Hence, spherical mirror may behave as a plane mirror as special case when its radius of curvature becomes infinity.\\n9. 2070 Supp (Set B) Q.No. 3 a A spherical mirror is cut in half horizontally. Will an image be formed by the botom half of the mirror? How?23 When we cut a shperical mirror into half horizontally, the radius of curvature is not changed. The focal length thus remains the same and the image formed will be that of the usual case. The only difference that happens is that the intensity of the images will be reduced as half of the part of the mirror is removed.\\n![img-32.jpeg](img-32.jpeg)\",\n",

[2] This is due to refraction (bending) of light while passing from water to air. In such case, object lies in denser medium and is viewed from rarer medium. So when light passes from denser to rarer medium, it bends away from normal so that real position is shifted to apparent position. Apparent depth is always less than real depth and hence, a clear pool of water always appears to be shallower than it is actually.\\n2. 2070 Supp (Set A) Q.No. 3 a Why does the sun look slightly oval when it is near the horison?\\n$>$ This is due to refraction of light when passes one medium to another. The density of the air in the atmosphere is greater near the surface of earth than above it. Thus, the magnitude of refraction increases with decreasing altitude. Due to this, the rays from the lower edge of the sun are bent more than the rays from the upper edge when situated at honizon. Hence, vertical diameter of the sun is shortened more than the horizontal diameter. That is why, the sun appears flattened at the time of sunset and sunrise because of refraction of light.\\n3. 2069 (Set A) Old Q. No. 6b A stick partially dipped in water seems to be bent. Why?\\n$>$ This is due to refraction of light. When a stick is partially dipped in water, due to refraction of light, it seems to be bent. When light rays pass from denser medium to rarer medium, then rays bent away from the normal. When a stick is placed in water partially, the light rays from different portions of the dipped part of the stick undergo bending away from the normal to reach the eyes. So, it seems to be bending.\\n4. 2062 Q.No. 6 b Can total internal reflection be achieved if object originates in rarer medium? Explain with a diagram to justify your answer.\\n$>$ No, total internal reflection can not be achieved if object originates in rarer medium. For total internal reflection, the light ray must pass from denser to rarer media and angle of incidence in denser medium must be greater than critical angle so that angle of refraction in rarer medium is $90^{\\\\circ}$.\\nIf light passes from rarer to denser medim, the light ray bend towards normal and can't be achieved total internal reflection.\\n![img-34.jpeg](img-34.jpeg)\\n5. 2061 Q.No. 6 b A ray of light in air strikes a glass surface. Is there a range of angles for which total internal reflection takes place?\\n$>$ No, there is not a range of angles for which total internal reflection takes place when a ray of light in air strikes a glass surface. It is because for total internal reflection, light should travel from denser medium to rarer medium. But here, air is rarer medium and glass is denser medium. So, this phenomenon does not happen in this case.\\n6. 2058 Q.No. 6 c Why does diamond sparkle?\\n$>$ Diamond shines because of total internal reflection of light. The refractive index of diamond is 2.4 and hence, its critical angle is small, $24.6^{\\\\circ}$. The surfaces of the diamond are cut such that light in it undergoes multiple total internal reflections. The light coming out of some faces makes brilliancy of the diamond.\\n7. 2057 Q.No. 6 b Why does the sun look a little oval when it is at the horizon?\\n$>$ Please refer to 2070 Supp (Set A) Q.No. 3 a\\n8. 2054 Q.No. 11 b Why do in summer, roads often appear to be covered with water when seen from a distance? Explain.\\n$>$ This is due to total internal reflection of light. In summer, during day time, the layers of air in contact with the road become very hot and upper layer of air remains cold, so the densities and refractive indices of these layers are lower than those of the cooler layers higher up. The rays of light from a distance object bend more and more as they pass through denser (cold air) to rarer (hot air) medium. When the beam falls on a layer at an angle greater than the critical angle for it, it gets totally reflected. These reflected rays then travel up and undergo a series of refractions, but in a direction opposite to those in the first case.\",\n",

From fig(ii), we see that the value of lateral shift slightly increases on increasing incident angle and become hightest on incident angle of $90^{\\\\circ}$.\\n11. 2076 Set B Q.No. 7a Define lateral shift and derive an expression for it due to a parallel edged glass slab.\\n$3 x$ Please refer to 2076 GIE Set B Q.No. 7a\\n12. 2074 Supp. Q.No. 7a What causes the bending of light when it passes from one medium to another medium? Deduce the relation, $\\\\mu=$ Real depth\\n$3 x$ When light passes from one medium to another medium, its wavelength and speed changes. Due to change in speed, it deviates from its original path and hence bends at boundary of two media. Thus difference in speed of light in different medium is the cause of bending of light while passes from one medium to another medium.\\nLet us consider a coin C is placed in a breaker containing a medium of refractive index, $\\\\mu$. Let CB, be the ray of light passing from denser medium and bends to BA while passing from denser medium.\",\n",

Explain. D\\n$>$ The minimum deviation ( $\\\\delta_{\\\\text {min }}$ ) of light occurs when the ray passes symmetrically through the prism. In this case, the angle of emergence is equal to the angle of incidence and angle of refracton at two faces are also equal. The refracted ray through the prism is also parallel to the base of the prism.\\n2. 2075 Set A Q.No. 34 What are the conditions for minimum deviation of a ray of light passing through a prism? D\\n$>$ Please refer to 2076 Set C Q No. 3 H\\n3. 2075 Set B Q.No. 34 A ray of light originated in air falls perpendicularly on the shorter face of a right angled isosceles $\\\\left(90^{\\\\circ}-45^{\\\\circ}-45^{\\\\circ}\\\\right)$ triangular glass prism of refractive index 1.5. Find the angle of deviation in this case in a diagram.\\n$>$ Let $A B C$ is an isosceles right angled prism such that $A B$ and $A C$ are equal. A ray of light PQ incidents on face AB perpendicularly such that it does not derivate and strikes face BC at R with incident angle $45^{\\\\circ}$, but $\\\\mu=1.5$ i.e. critical angle (C) becomes $42^{\\\\circ}\\\\left(\\\\therefore \\\\mu=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sin C}\\\\right)$.\\nHere incident angle becomes greater than critical angle and total\\n![img-46.jpeg](img-46.jpeg)\\ninternal reflection takes place. As a result light ray emerges through path RST. Here derivation angle becomes $90^{\\\\circ}$.\\n4. 2074 Supp. Q.No. 3 H A glass prism is immersed in water. What happens to the value of angle of minimum deviation?\\n$>$ The refractive index $(\\\\mu)$ of a glass prism with angle (A) and minimum deviation $\\\\delta_{\\\\mathrm{m}}$ are related by a formula,\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mu=\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{Sin}\\\\left(\\\\frac{A+\\\\delta_{\\\\mathrm{m}}}{2}\\\\right)}{\\\\operatorname{Sin}\\\\left(\\\\frac{A}{2}\\\\right)}\\n$$\\n\\nWhen the glass prism is immersed in water, the refractive index decreases and hence angle of ntinimum deviation also decease being direct relationship.\\n5. 2074 Set A Q.No. 3 H What do you understand by minimum deviation in the case of refraction through a prism? Plot a graph between angles of incidence and the deviation produced.\\n$>$ When the angle of incidence increases, the deviation angle at first decreases, reaches to a minimum value and again increases. The minimum value of deviation angle is called minimum deviation angle. It is the condition at which the deviation angle is minimum and starts to increase on increasing incident angle beyond this. At minimum deviation condition, angle of incidence and angle of emergence are equal, the refracting angles at both faces are equal and the refracted light ray inside the prism is parallel to base of prism.\\n![img-47.jpeg](img-47.jpeg)\\n6. 2066 Old Q. No. 6 c] State the factors on which the deviation produced by a prism depend.\\n$>$ The deviation produced by the prism depends upon the angle of prism, refractive index of a medium, angle of incidence, color of light and the medium around the prism.\\n7. 2060 Q.No. 6 d What are the advantages of total reflecting prism over plane mirror?\\n$>$ The advantages of total reflecting prism over plane mirror are:\\na. When light is reflected from total reflecting prism, whole of the light is totally internally reflected. However, from plane mirror, only about $90 \\\\%$ of incident light is reflected. Therefore, intensity of reflected light is more in prism than that of the light reflected from plane mirror.\\nb. No multiple reflections take place in total reflecting prism as in plane mirror.\\nc. The image is not laterally inverted in case of total reflecting prism as in plane mirror.',\n",

How is this possible?\\n$>$\\n2. When a comb runs through hair, it gets charged due to friction with hair. This charged comb when brought close to paper, it induces opposite charge on paper pieces and attracts to paper even though they no net charge. If the hair is wet, instead of dry, the friction between hair and comb is highly reduced and hence, comb is less charged. Thus, it cannot attract the paper.\\n3. 2076 Set C Q.No. 4a What do you mean by quantization of charge? Explain.\\n$>$ The charges on any charged body are integral multiple of basic unit of charge. This basic unit of charge is taken as the charge on an electron or a proton which is equal to $\\\\pm 1.6 \\\\times 10^{-19} \\\\mathrm{C}$. Therefore the charge on any body is, $Q= \\\\pm \\\\mathrm{n}$ e where e is the charge on an electron and n is any integer. This property of charge is called the quantization of electric charge. This means the charges on the body are not in fraction number i.e. they are in whole number.\\n4. 2075 GIE Q.No. 4a We often experience the sparks during the winter nights when removing the cloths from our body. Why?\\n$>$ In winter season, our body is dry but not wet. When we remove our clothes from out body, the charges are produced due to friction between the body and clothes. As a result, some sparks are produced.\\n5. 2075 Set A Q.No. 4a Why metallic chain is used in the tanker transporting highly inflammable liquid?\\n$>$ The vehicles get charged due to the friction during motion. The body of vehicles also gets charged due to friction of air. If the accumulation of charge is enough, it causes sparking and the inflammable material may catch fire and explosion may happen. When an iron or metallic chain is suspended from the vehicle, it drags charges from body of vehicle to ground. Hence, the iron chain prevent from explosion.\\n6. 2075 Set B Q.No. 4b How can a body be charged with positive electricity by the method of induction? Explain.

Explain.\\n$>$ Yes, a charged body can attract an uncharged body. When the charged body is taken to near an uncharged body, the uncharged body gets charged by induction method. The induced charges nearer to the end of charge body are unlike while far end are like charges. According to the nature of unlike charges, they attract with each other.\\n8. 2072 Supp Q.No. 4 How do you charge a body with positive electricity by induction?

The body which loses electrons is positively charged because there will deficit of electrons and the other body which gains electrons is negatively charged because there will be excess of electrons (negative charge). In this way, transformation of electrons from one body to another body electrified both two bodies on rubbing.\\n10. 2072 Set D Q.No. 4 Two charged conductors are touched mutually and then separated.

What would be the reason behind it?\\n$>$ During the landing there is a friction between the tyres of the aircraft and the runway. This develops charge on the tyres. If the accumulation of charge becomes high, it may lead to sparkling and fire. If the tyres are made slightly conducting, the charge will not accumulate on it and leak to ground. So, . the tyres of airplane are made from a rubber which is reasonably good conductor of electricity.\\n13. 2070 Set C Q.No. 4 Can a charged body attract an uncharged body?

Explain.\\n$>$ If the surface of a charged metal sphere is rough, it contains many minute projections through which charges start to leak. This is because the electric field intensity is very high at such projections which cause to occur discharge of gases near it. This can be minimized if the surface of the charged metal sphere is polished. That's why, more charge can be stored on a metal sphere if it is highly polished than when its surface is rough.\\n15. 2069 Supp Q.No. 4 Why are the four footed animals posed to more threat during close by lightning strike than the two footed humans?\\n$>$ The four feet of the four footed animal remain in contact with ground while two feet of the human are attached with earth.

So, the four footed animals posed to more threat during close by lightning strike than the two footed humans.\\n16. 2069 (Set A) Q.

The document provides the formula:  γ = ΔV / (V(θ₂ - θ₁)), and states that the ratio of ΔV/V is the same in each case for a liquid, so the coefficient of cubical expansion is the same for all.\\n*   **Relation to Linear Expansivity:** Document 4 mentions deriving a relation between linear and cubical expansivities, suggesting there is a mathematical connection between the two.'"
