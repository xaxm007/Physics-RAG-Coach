The context refers to question 8a of 2070 Set D for the definition of electrostatic induction and how to charge a body positively by induction. Additionally, 2072 Supp Q.No. 4 and 2075 Set B Q.No. 4 also explain how to charge a body with positive electricity by induction.\\n\\nCharging by induction involves bringing a charged object near a neutral object. Without contact, the charges within the neutral object redistribute. To charge the neutral object positively, a negatively charged object is brought near it. This repels the negative charges in the neutral object to the far side, leaving the near side with a positive charge. The far side is then grounded, allowing the repelled electrons to flow away. Finally, the ground connection is removed, and then the negatively charged object is removed, leaving the formerly neutral object with a net positive charge.'}\n"
